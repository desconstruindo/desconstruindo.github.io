### [photos]
I don't consider myself even an amateur photographer, but I like to make some 
shots anyway, usually urban and nature landscapes from places I've visited. 
None of the photos received any treatment.

Please **don't use** these photos without permission, they are no big deal but 
have value to me. You can reach me [here](/about).
