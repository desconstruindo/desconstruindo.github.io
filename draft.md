#### Introduction

I'm a huge fan of automation for many reasons: it's a one-time job, it saves time when thinking under the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix){:target="_blank"} perspective since we are somehow delegating the task execution and it's less prone to errors.

It's possible to find many other reasons to automate tasks, specially those boring, but in my particular case as a software engineer usually I say that **I know I will make a mistake, just don't know when**. This is a very honest statement when I see myself as a human being and prone to make mistakes and there's some specific situations where I'm not open to take the risk. That's my motivation to write a little about automation.

When working in a software development project with a considerable base of code within hundred of thousands of lines and/or a team that's not only you, the [software quality](https://blog.codacy.com/iso-25010-software-quality-model){:target="_blank"} in regard to the maintainability attributes, specially testability, becomes a challenge do manage.

At the same time we are developing new features we also need to write new tests to improve the reliability of our system by making sure the errors will not be hidden. As I've already stated, if I assume I'll make mistakes so I must assume that my code will have errors as well. Therefore how we will approach that situation is the key.

Lots of good tools are available which help to setup environments and easily trigger all kinds of tests, from simple unit to complete integrated system tests, and usually these are available under the CI/CD pipelines.

I'm writing the configuration management plan document for the project I'm currently part of and along with the committing, branching, versioning and other strategies this document states, I started to look for an easy solution for a common problem: when the developer commits against a branch which will trigger a set of verification actions and simply forgets to run a minimum set of tests locally.

This is very annoying for many reasons but the most important I would say that's the time you spend since it will be necessary to make a fix and a new commit or update a pull request and finally trigger the verification pipeline once again. Think about doing that many times a day, that's why I consider this a boring task and good to be automated.

### Linux home studio part 1: introduction

This is intended to be a series of various posts (I wish) where I'll cover the step-by-step of my own experience of using Linux as a system to compose, record and perhaps produce music. For me, share this experience is very important because I've been pursuing this goal for many years.

I'm a Linux user since 1999 and since them I've been following the changes and improvements in this operating system in many areas, from server applications until most basic - daily use - workstation applications. Linux users are commonly saw as hackers or people that doesn't like graphical interfaces, but it's not absolutely true (most part). The use of the Linux as primary operating system is related with freedom in many aspects and other stuff that is not the purpose of this text to discuss.
