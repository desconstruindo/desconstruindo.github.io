Here's the academic texts that I've produced so far, as part of my undergraduate 
and graduation courses.

#### Considerations on Cyber Security in Automotive Embedded Systems.
Research on the cyber security applied to the automotive embedded systems. 
Based on the literature review, the main concepts related with the automotive 
systems and networks are presented, focusing their main characteristics, use 
and the impact of security on systems, users, companies and governments as well.

The security of embedded automotive systems is addressed through the construction 
and analysis of a threat model, offering a practical overview of the concepts 
presented. Lastly are presented cases of vulnerabilities and security attacks 
to the automotive embedded systems.

#### Embedded System for Power Quality Monitoring
This project presents the development and construction of an embedded system 
that monitors the various aspects that impacts on power quality in a single-phase 
electrical installation, in order to characterize the performance of this 
installation based on parameters established by the PRODIST document, prepared 
by the National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL).

The developed system consists of a first electronics instrumentation stage for 
conditioning and measuring of voltage, current and frequency signals, followed 
by sampling, analog-to-digital conversion and finally the data processing for 
information presentation.

By building the prototype it was possible to perform measurements, obtaining as 
the results the performance characterization for the monitored electrical 
installation through the power quality indicators established by PRODIST.
