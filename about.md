### [about]
I'm electrical engineer, technology enthusiast and jazz guitar player with 
influences in Brazilian music.

I work as a software developer (C, C++, Python) and also research in Embedded 
Systems, Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning.

Occasionally I try to compose some music and build some cool electronic stuff and games.
