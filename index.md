#### Considerations on Cyber Security in Automotive Embedded Systems
The following is the abstract of my post graduation (specialization) project on 
Embedded Systems for Automotive Industry.

A research on the cyber security applied to the automotive embedded systems. 
Based on the literature review, the main concepts related with the automotive 
systems and networks are presented, focusing their main characteristics, use and 
the impact of security on systems, users, companies and governments as well.

The security of embedded automotive systems is addressed through the construction 
and analysis of a threat model, offering a practical overview of the concepts 
presented. Lastly are presented cases of vulnerabilities and security attacks to 
the automotive embedded systems.
