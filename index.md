#### Getting started with ESP32 and MicroPython
This is the first text of a serie (I hope so), where I'm going to use this
solution to build a environment monitoring system that later will be integrated
with AWS.

[In this first article](./articles/getting_started_with_esp32_and_micropython),
I'll cover the basics from installation to get the whole system up and running
on Linux.

#### Academic texts
I've put [here](./articles) the academic texts for the projects that I've worked
so far, these are works in engineering, focused on embedded systems and security. 

For now there is only Portuguese versions, but my intention is to translate to 
English some day.
